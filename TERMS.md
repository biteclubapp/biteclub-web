## BiteClub Terms of Service

Last updated: August 18, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the BiteClub mobile application and related services (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

### 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian.

### 2. Account and Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to provide accurate information and to notify us promptly of any unauthorized use or security breach.

### 3. User Content

You may upload, post, and share content such as photos, videos, captions, comments, recipes, and meals ("User Content"). You retain your rights in your User Content. By posting User Content on the Service, you grant BiteClub a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, store, reproduce, modify (solely for display and formatting), publish, and display your User Content for the purpose of operating and improving the Service. You can end this license for specific content by deleting it or deleting your account, except to the extent the content has been shared with others or is retained in routine backups for a limited time.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to post your User Content and that your User Content does not violate any law or the rights of any third party.

### 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Engage in illegal, harmful, or fraudulent activity
- Post content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, hateful, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable
- Infringe the intellectual property or privacy rights of others
- Attempt to access accounts or data without authorization
- Upload viruses, malware, or other harmful code
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its networks

We may remove content and/or suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

### 5. Intellectual Property

The Service, including software, design, and branding, is owned by BiteClub or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the limited rights expressly granted here, no license is granted to you.

### 6. In‑App Features and Notifications

Some features, such as push notifications and contact discovery, require your permission. You can enable or disable these features in your device settings or within the app settings.

### 7. Third‑Party Services

The Service integrates with third‑party services such as Supabase (authentication/database), Cloudflare Images/Stream (media storage/delivery), Cloudflare Workers (media API and cleanup), Expo (push notifications), and Sentry (error reporting). Your use of these features may be subject to the third‑party providers’ terms and privacy policies.

### 8. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time and may delete your account in Settings. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if we believe it is necessary to protect the Service or other users. Upon termination, certain provisions survive, including ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution.

### 9. Disclaimers

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” BITECLUB DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR‑FREE, OR THAT CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOST OR ALTERED.

### 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BITECLUB WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

### 11. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BiteClub and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service or your violation of these Terms.

### 12. Changes to the Service or Terms

We may modify or discontinue the Service, or update these Terms, at any time. If changes materially affect your rights, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., in‑app notice). Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

### 13. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws principles. You agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute with us informally. If we cannot resolve it, disputes will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.

### 14. App Store EULA

If you downloaded the App from Apple’s App Store, your use of the App is also subject to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA). In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Apple’s EULA regarding the App’s license terms, Apple’s EULA will govern to the extent required by Apple’s policies.
