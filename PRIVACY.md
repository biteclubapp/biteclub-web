## BiteClub Privacy Policy

Last updated: August 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how BiteClub collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

### Summary for App Store Privacy

- **Data used to track you**: None. We do not use third‑party advertising and do not track you across apps or websites.
- **Data linked to you**: Contact info (phone, optional email), identifiers (user ID, username), user content (photos, videos, captions, comments, recipes/meals), contacts (optional phone numbers for discovery), and diagnostics (limited error context).
- **Data not linked to you**: Basic analytics/usage logs may be collected in aggregate; we do not build profiles for advertising.

### What We Collect

| Category | Examples | Purpose | Required? | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account identifiers | Phone (for SMS sign‑in), optional email, username, name, avatar URL | Account creation, authentication, social features | Phone or email required to sign in | Until account deletion |
| User content | Photos, videos, captions, comments, likes, recipes, meals, collections | Provide core social/journaling features | Optional but necessary to post | Until you delete content or your account |
| Contacts matching (optional) | Phone numbers you choose to share for "find friends" | One‑time matching to find existing users | Optional | Query‑time only; not stored as new records |
| Notifications | Expo push token, on‑device reminder times | Deliver push reminders and in‑app notifications | Optional | While enabled; removed on disable/sign‑out |
| Usage & device data | App interactions, error logs; device type (iOS/Android) | App functionality, performance, debugging | Collected automatically | Short‑term logs; diagnostics per provider policy |
| Sensitive data | Precise location, health, financial, biometric | Not collected | N/A | N/A |

We request device permissions for the camera, photos/library, notifications, and contacts (only if you opt into discovery). You can change permissions in your device settings at any time.

### How We Use Information

- Provide and secure the App, authenticate users, and maintain your account
- Enable social features (following, posting, commenting, liking)
- Deliver push notifications and daily reminders you configure
- Improve performance, debug issues, and protect against abuse

We do not sell your personal data and we do not use your data for third‑party advertising or cross‑app tracking.

### Sharing and Disclosures

We share data with service providers acting on our behalf:

- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Cloudflare Images/Stream** for media storage and delivery
- **Cloudflare Workers** for media API (signing/upload tokens/deletions) and scheduled media cleanup
- **Expo** for push notification delivery
- **Sentry (Toucan)** for error reporting on backend workers (may include user ID/email strictly for debugging)

We may disclose information to comply with law, protect rights and safety, or as part of a business transfer.

### Retention and Deletion

- Your content and profile persist until you delete them or delete your account
- Push tokens are retained only while notifications are enabled
- Contacts matching operates at query time; numbers are not stored beyond the lookup
- Backups and logs retain limited data for a short period for security and reliability
- When you delete your account (via Settings), your profile, content, and media are removed from active systems; media deletions propagate via scheduled cleanup and may take up to ~1 hour

### Your Choices and Rights

- Manage notification categories, reminder times, and opt out at any time
- Skip contacts access; no contacts matching occurs without your consent
- Access, update, or delete your account in Settings; you may also contact us using the information below

### Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided us personal data, contact us to delete it.

### International Transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in the United States or other countries where our providers operate. We rely on contractual and technical safeguards to protect your information.

### Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

### Third‑Party Links

The App may contain links to third‑party sites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

### Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice.
